## Mock Blog API Expansion

This project uses Node.js/Express. It provides expansion on an existing API that was limited to fetching one category tag (e.g. history, tech) to allow fetching of multiple tags concurrently using asynchronous Promises. It also caches the API results with the tag as the key for five (5) minutes to improve latency on common fetches. 

### Initial Set-Up

This project has replaced the original API URL with `<URL>` for confidentiality purposes - this project cannot be run without it.
